100DaysOfCode Day-to-Day Progress
Day 1
Today's Progress
Set up my development environment:
Installed VS Code and necessary extensions
Configured Git and GitHub
Reviewed the basics of HTML and CSS
Built a simple web page with a header, paragraph, and a button
Learned about Flexbox for layout and applied it to center elements on the page
Thoughts
Today's session was mostly about getting everything set up and refreshing some basics. It feels good to have a clean environment and to start coding again. The Flexbox layout system is quite intuitive, and I look forward to using it more.

Day 2
Today's Progress
Continued working on the basic web page from Day 1
Added more content to the page, including an image and a list
Learned about and implemented basic CSS styling for the web page elements
Experimented with CSS properties like margins, padding, and colors
Started learning about CSS Grid and applied it to create a simple layout
Thoughts
Today's focus was on enhancing the content and style of the web page. It was interesting to see how CSS can transform a plain HTML page into something visually appealing. CSS Grid seems powerful for layout design, and I'm excited to delve deeper into it.

Day 3
Today's Progress
Reviewed CSS Grid and practiced creating complex layouts
Added a navigation bar to the web page
Implemented responsive design principles using media queries
Learned about and experimented with CSS animations and transitions
Refined the styling of the web page to improve the overall design
Thoughts
Today was a productive day focusing on responsive design and layout. CSS Grid is incredibly versatile, and learning to make the web page responsive was a valuable experience. Adding animations and transitions made the page feel more dynamic and engaging.

Day 4
Today's Progress
Started learning JavaScript basics
Covered variables, data types, and basic operations
Practiced using let, const, and var
Wrote simple scripts to manipulate the DOM
Added and removed HTML elements dynamically
Updated CSS styles through JavaScript
Created a simple interactive feature on the web page:
A button that changes the background color of a section
Thoughts
Diving into JavaScript was both challenging and exciting. Understanding how to manipulate the DOM and interact with HTML/CSS using JavaScript opens up many possibilities for dynamic web pages. The interactive feature was a small but significant step towards making the web page more engaging.

Day 5
Today's Progress
Continued learning JavaScript:
Explored functions and their various forms (declarations, expressions, arrow functions)
Practiced using control structures (if statements, loops)
Implemented event listeners to add interactivity:
Created a form that captures user input and displays it on the page
Added click events to buttons for various actions
Improved the interactive feature by:
Allowing users to input their preferred background color
Validating the input to ensure it is a valid color code
Thoughts
JavaScript is starting to make more sense, and I'm getting more comfortable with its syntax and features. Adding event listeners was particularly fun, as it really brought the web page to life. The form validation was a bit tricky, but it was satisfying to get it working correctly.
